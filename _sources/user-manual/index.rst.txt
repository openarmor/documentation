User manual
================

Welcome to the Armor user manual. Use it as your Armor reference library once you have a basic Armor installation in place. In the same way that the main components of Armor are a fork of the renowned OSSEC HIDS project, so this user manual has been derived from the `OSSEC documentation <http://ossec.github.io/docs/>`_. Kudos to the OSSEC team for their huge contribution to the IT security community.
