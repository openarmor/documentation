RESTful API
==========================

The Armor API is an open source RESTful API that allows the Armor manager to be interacted with from a web browser, command line tool like cURL, or any script or program that can make web requests.  The Armor Kibana app relies on this heavily, and Armor's goal is to accommodate complete remote management of the Armor infrastructure via the Armor Kibana app. Use the API to easily perform everyday actions like adding an agent, restarting the manager/agent(s), or looking up syscheck details.

For more details, see :ref:`Use Cases <armor_api_use_cases>`.

Armor API capabilities:

* Agent management
* Manager control & overview
* Rootcheck control & search
* Syscheck control & search
* Ruleset information
* Statistical information
* HTTPS and user authentication
* Error handling
