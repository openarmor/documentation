The following is required to set up the monitoring of a specific command's output on agents:

Configure Armor agents to accept remote commands from the manager
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Agents do have the ability to run commands pushed from the manager (via the files in the ``shared`` directory). Before this feature can be used, it needs to be explicitly allowed at an agent level. This can be done by setting the :ref:`logcollector.remote_commands <ossec_internal_logcollector>` in ``local_internal_options.conf`` on each agent.

Example::

  # Logcollector - Whether or not to accept remote commands from the manager
  logcollector.remote_commands=1

Configure a command to monitor
------------------------------

The commands to run and monitor, can be configured either inside the local :ref:`ossec.conf <reference_ossec_conf>` of individual agents, but the ideal location would be the appropriate config section of :ref:`agent.conf <reference_agent_conf>` on the manager.

Example::

  <localfile>
       <log_format>full_command</log_format>
       <command>.....</command>
       <frequency>120</frequency>
  </localfile>

Process the output
------------------

After configuring the system to monitor the command's output as if it were log data, we can create custom rules like for :ref:`Log analysis <manual_log_analysis>`, in order to process the output and alert when is needed.
