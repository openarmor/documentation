command

.. topic:: XML section name

	.. code-block:: xml

		<command>
		</command>

In a command configuration section, you define a command to be used by one or more active responses. It is possible to have as many commands as needed, but each one must be in their own separate <command> section.

Options
-------

- `name`_
- `executable`_
- `expect`_
- `timeout_allowed`_

name
^^^^

This field specifies the name of the command which is called in the :doc:`active-response <active-response>` section.

+--------------------+---------------+
| **Default value**  | n/a           |
+--------------------+---------------+
| **Allowed values** | Any name      |
+--------------------+---------------+
| **use**            | Required      |
+--------------------+---------------+

executable
^^^^^^^^^^

This must be a file (with the execute permission set) inside ``/var/ossec/active-response/bin``.
You donâ€™t need to provide the path.

+--------------------+---------------+
| **Default value**  | n/a           |
+--------------------+---------------+
| **Allowed values** | Any file name |
+--------------------+---------------+
| **use**            | Required      |
+--------------------+---------------+

expect
^^^^^^

This is a list of zero or more names of extracted fields that are to be passed as parameters to the command. If any of the listed fields were not extracted in a certain instance, those field values would be passed as a dash (``-``) instead of as no value at all. A good example is the firewall-block command which expects the ``srcip`` field so it knows which IP to block.  Multiple expected field names are comma separated.

+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Default value**  | n/a                                                                                                       |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Allowed values** | Names of extracted fields, like **srcip** or **username**, separated by commas if there is more than one. |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **use**            | Required                                                                                                  |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::

   You can specify no fields by using ``<expect></expect>``.  That is the valid setting when no options need to be passed to the active-response command.


timeout_allowed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If yes, this indicates that the command is stateful, and will be called again in a certain length of time and instructed to undo its original action.

+--------------------+--------+
| **Default value**  | yes    |
+--------------------+--------+
| **Allowed values** | yes/no |
+--------------------+--------+
