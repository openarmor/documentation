# Armor Documentation Theme v3.0

This Sphinx theme is designed to give a better reader experience for documentation users on both desktop and mobile devices, with a more accessible design. It also includes some SEO improvements.

This repository includes a working version of the assets this new theme requires, already compiled, concatenated and minified. However, if new changes are required to the style or functionality, the modification must be done on the source files that originate the assets, that is SCSS files for the style and non-minified JavaScript files for the scripts. Once the source files are modified, the assets must be compiled and then updated in the repository so that they can be used in the process of compiling the documentation.

This document explains the basic process for the assets compilation that needs to be done ONLY when the theme needs to be modified (not the content).

## Pre-requisites

The compilation of the theme assets is done using several node packages, thus, having an updated version of Node.js and NPM is the main requirement. You can visit https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm for more details.

With Node.js and NPM already installed, we still need to install or update the node packages required for the compilation of the assets.

### Install/update the Node packages

In order to install or update the Node packages, change to the theme directory, where the file `package.json` is located, that is `source/_themes/armor_doc_theme_v3`. On this location run the next command:

```
npm install
```

That's all. This will install the missing packages, remove ones no longer required and update the version of every package to the one specified in `package.json`.

## Theme assets compilation process

The final compiled and minified assets are included in the repository, however, they might need to be modified. If that is the case, they need to be rebuild once the modification is done, and then committed to the repository again. The theme .min.\* files must be updated in the repository before the compilation of the documentation with Sphinx.

**Note**: When possible, avoid changing the theme and the content (.rst files) in the same commit.

These are the steps to make basic modifications to the theme assets:

1. In a new branch, make the required changes to the SCSS files within the folder (or subfolders of) `source/_themes/armor_doc_theme_v3/src/scss/` or the JS files within `source/_themes/armor_doc_theme_v3/src/js-source/`.

2. Rebuild the assets once the change is done. There are several scripts to do this, but they all are run in the same way: `npm run <script>`. These are some options:

   - Changes in SCSS and JS:
     - Build the custom assets of the main documents (excludes Bootstrap, google-fonts CSS, moved-content, index-redirect JS):

       ```
       npm run build
       ```

       This option can also be run through Makefile in the root of the repository folder:

       ```
       make theme
       ```

     - Build all the assets (includes all, even Bootstrap):

       ```
       npm run build-all
       ```
   - Changes only in SCSS:
     - Build the custom CSS of the main documents (excludes Bootstrap, google-fonts CSS, moved-content):

       ```
       npm run css:build
       ```

     - Build all the CSS files (includes all, even Bootstrap):

       ```
       npm run css:build-all
       ```
   - Changes only in JS:
     - Build the custom JS of the main documents (excludes Bootstrap, moved-content, index-redirect JS):

       ```
       npm run js:build
       ```

     - Build all the JS files (includes all, even Bootstrap):

       ```
       npm run js:build-all
       ```

3. Commit all the changes in the theme files, including the source files in `source/_themes/armor_doc_theme_v3/src/scss/` and `source/_themes/armor_doc_theme_v3/src/js-source/`, but also the resulting files in `source/_themes/armor_doc_theme_v3/static/css/` and `source/_themes/armor_doc_theme_v3/static/js/`.
