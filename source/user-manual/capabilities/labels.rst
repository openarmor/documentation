Agent labels
=======================

This feature provides the opportunity to customize alerts information from agents, giving us the chance of
include specific information of each agent which could be useful when dealing with alerts. In addition, in large
environments it could be used to distinguish groups of agents by any common characteristic like their time zone, for example.

The following sections shows how this feature works as well as an use case.

- `How it works`_
- `Use case`_

How it works
------------

Configuring labels for being shown at alerts is too simple. It can be done using a simple XML structure which allows to add
information with the format ``key:value``, how to configure them it is explained at :doc:`Labels section <../reference/ossec-conf/labels>` section
of ``ossec.conf``. It is remarkable that it exists the possibility of using dots to split "key" names nesting them in JSON formatted alerts.

It is also allowed to centralize it using ``agent.conf``. This way, from the manager side it is
possible to set labels for specific agents. Note that whether it exists a duplicated label key in ``ossec.conf`` and ``agent.conf``,
the second one will override the first one. For more information about usage of centralized configuration see its dedicated
section: :doc:`Centralized configuration <../reference/centralized-configuration>`.

In addition, more technical configuration is available in :doc:`Internal configuration <../reference/internal-options>`. Particularly,
``analysisd.label_cache_maxage`` and ``analysisd.show_hidden_labels``.

Use case
--------

It is interesting to think about a scenario where the use of labels could be useful. Let's imagine we have a large environment deployed
in Amazon Web Service (AWS) and monitored by Armor. In that situation, we want to know in the manager the following information about
each agent when an alert is triggered:

- AWS instance-id.
- AWS Security group.
- Network IP address.
- Network MAC.
- Date of installation (hidden).

To include these labels into alerts of a specific agent, it is necessary to set the following configuration in ``ossec.conf``:

.. code-block:: xml

        <labels>
          <label key="aws.instance-id">i-052a1838c</label>
          <label key="aws.sec-group">sg-1103</label>
          <label key="network.ip">172.17.0.0</label>
          <label key="network.mac">02:42:ac:11:00:02</label>
          <label key="installation" hidden="yes">January 1st, 2017</label>
        </labels>

Whether the configuration is set from the manager, the configuration has to be set in ``agent.conf`` using this format:

.. code-block:: xml

      <agent_config name="92603de31548">
        <labels>
          <label key="aws.instance-id">i-052a1838c</label>
          <label key="aws.sec-group">sg-1103</label>
          <label key="network.ip">172.17.0.0</label>
          <label key="network.mac">02:42:ac:11:00:02</label>
          <label key="installation" hidden="yes">January 1st, 2017</label>
        </labels>
      </agent_config>

When an alert is fired for this agent, the previous configuration will add to alerts the specified information:

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5,6

    ** Alert 1488922301.778562: mail  - ossec,syscheck,pci_dss_11.5,

    aws.instance-id: i-052a1838c
    aws.sec-group: sg-1103

And the same alert in JSON format shows the advantage of using splitting in "key" names:

.. code-block:: javascript
