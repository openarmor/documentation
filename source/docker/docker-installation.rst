Docker installation
===================

The first thing you need to do is install Docker if you don't have it already.

Docker engine
----------------------------------------------
Docker requires a 64-bit operating system running kernel version 3.10 or higher.

To check your current kernel version, open a terminal and use ``uname -r`` to display your kernel version::

   $ sudo uname -r
   3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64

Run the Docker installation script.

.. code-block:: console

   # curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

::

  $ sudo usermod -aG docker your-user

.. note:: Remember that you will have to log out and log back in for this to take effect.

Docker compose
----------------------------------------------

Docker compose 1.6 or newer is required. Install it like this:

.. code-block:: console

    # curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.12.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    # chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Test the installation:

::

  $ docker-compose --version
  docker-compose version 1.12.0, build b31ff33
